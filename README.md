Thoughts on the articale:

This article uses a fun and straight-forward approach to discuss the idea that every line of code comes with a maintenance cost, and to reduce this cost, it's essential to focus on creating code that is easy to delete rather than to extend. The author emphasizes that code should be viewed as "lines spent" rather than "lines produced," advocating for disposable software over reusability. This is important to all programmers when collaborating.

Thank you for sharing such an informative article! 

I never thought of codes as in the "easy-to-delete parts". Coding with the mindset of disposability ensures that our projects remain agile and responsive to change. This is certainly something refreshing for me.
